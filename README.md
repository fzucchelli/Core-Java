          This Repository covers Object oriented Conceptes in Java..
               Java is a programming language used for both client-server programs, web applications and Android development.
          It is one of the most popular programming languages and runs on all platforms via the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
          Javaâ€™s syntax was originally derived from C and C++ and was created by Sun Microsystems between 1991 and 1995.
          While it is mostly considered to be an object-oriented language, it is really more of a multi-paradigm language due to the inclusion of imperative and generic paradigms.
          It is a statically typed language and has various type-safety features built right in.
